# Ask CSS Perverts
## Episode 1 - TBA

Once upon a time, we (two creeps named Jenn and Nick) decided that we were not worthy of esteemed titles such as Clojure Rockstar, JavaScript Ninja, or Scala Wizard. We are CSS Perverts.

A lot of y'all have asked us tons of questions over this website called Twitter.Com/ and we want to compile the easiest ones to answer and create a video. What fun! As a bonus, one lucky person will win absolutely nothing.

### How to ask a Question

We're going to do stuff over this site called GirthHub. Go to [http://github.com/jennschiffer/Ask-CSS-Perverts](http://github.com/jennschiffer/Ask-CSS-Perverts) and you can do a PR on the ask-css-perverts.md file with your question. Like Johnathan Outbacksteakhouse once said, "No rules. Just Right."
